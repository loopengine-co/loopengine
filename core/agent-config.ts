 * `core/http-notifier.ts`'s `resolveHttpNotifier` — see that module for
 * the actual `WebhookNotifier`/signed-POST construction.
 *
 * Only ever consulted for the `http` channel, and only as a fallback
 * *there*: `RunAgentOptions.approver`/`questionHandler` (an adapter's own
 * per-call default — `adapters/http.ts`'s plain route always passes one)
 * still loses to this when it's set, the same "the agent's own explicit

 * here — but an explicit `AgentConfig.onRunStart`/`onRunFinish`, if also
 * set, still wins outright over this field's own derived hooks (no
 * per-call value competes with those the way `options.approver` does).
 *
 * `cli`/`http_stream` never consult this at all, not even as a fallback
 * — they keep the library's own live defaults (`ConsoleApprover`,
 * `CliQuestionHandler`, or whatever live approver the adapter passes as
 * `RunAgentOptions.approver`) automatically, with nothing to configure.
 * This isn't a limitation to work around: a durable webhook stands in
 * for a human who isn't there to answer live, which is exactly what
 * `http` (no open connection to block on) needs and `cli`/`http_stream`
 * (a real human already attached, live, right now) don't. There's also

 * custom *live* approver, the way a former `approvers.cli`/
 * `approvers.http_stream` entry could — see `RunAgentOptions.approver`'s
 * own doc comment if a specific call genuinely needs one; a whole demo
 * agent auto-approving on every channel (this repo used to have two)
 * turned out to be exactly the "config re-deriving the same webhook
 * settings a real approver already has" duplication this field exists
 * to remove, not a use case worth keeping a separate field alive for.
 *
 * Six channels ship today, `resolveHttpNotifier` (`core/http-notifier.ts`)
 * switches on which — each one's own sending-side class lives under

 *   - `'webhook'` — a signed HMAC-SHA256 POST, via
 *     `http-notify-triggers/webhook.ts`'s `WebhookNotifier` (one
 *     instance for both concerns, same shape as `'slack'`/`'lark'`/
 *     `'email'` below — not actauth's own `WebhookApprover` plus a
 *     separate loopengine question class anymore; see that file's own
 *     doc comment for why they merged) — plus the lifecycle sender
 *     neither approvals nor questions needed on their own.
 *   - `'slack'` — bot-token `chat.postMessage`, via
 *     `http-notify-triggers/slack.ts`'s `SlackNotifier`.
 *   - `'lark'` — Lark/Feishu's own card API, via
 *     `http-notify-triggers/lark.ts`'s `LarkNotifier` (lower
 *     confidence on exact card-schema field names — see that file's own
 *     header comment).
 *   - `'email'` — a `sendEmail` callback plus a signed, expiring
 *     magic-link token per approval/question, via
 *     `http-notify-triggers/email.ts`'s `EmailNotifier`.
 *   - `'database'`/`'redis'` — not a notification channel at all (see
 *     `ApprovalOnlyHttpNotifierEvent`'s own doc comment): a row insert or
 *     a queue push for a separate worker/dashboard to poll, via
 *     `http-notify-triggers/database.ts`'s `DatabaseApprover`/
 *     `http-notify-triggers/redis.ts`'s `RedisQueueApprover`.
 *     `'approval'` is the only event either ever does anything with.
 *
 * `'webhook'`/`'slack'`/`'lark'`/`'email'` post an interactive message
 * (buttons, a card, or a link) for `'approval'`/`'question'`, and a plain
 * announcement (no buttons — nothing to resolve) for
 * `'run_start'`/`'run_finish'`. The discriminated union shape (`channel`
 * plus a matching `config`) is what lets a future kind be added later as
 * another member, not another AgentConfig field. For anything none of
 * these cover (a channel not listed above, a live `QuestionHandler` on
 * `http`, ...) set `onRunStart`/`onRunFinish` directly instead, or pass a
