 * shares that field with), so it survives a restart instead of being
 * lost on one. Only genuinely-unresolved slugs pay for a live fetch, and
 * for those this still enriches with Composio's real catalog description
 * (see withRealComposioDescriptions) before persisting — unlike
 * connectEntry, which doesn't (see that function's own reasoning), this
 * is an occasional operator action, not runAgent()'s hot path, so paying
 * for the better description once, at resolution time, is worth it here.
 * Pass `force: true` (the admin page's own "Refresh" button) to treat
 * every slug as unresolved and overwrite their persisted entries with a
 * fresh live check — e.g. after reconnecting an account, or on the rare
 * chance a schema changed upstream without gateway-tools.yml itself
