# LoopEngine

[![CI](https://github.com/loopengine-co/loopengine/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/loopengine-co/loopengine/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

LoopEngine is a runtime for building AI agents: a persona, a set of tools,
and permission rules, run through a transparent ReAct loop. No chain DSL,
no hidden control flow — `core/run-agent.ts` is a single function you can read
top to bottom. Run agents over a CLI, an HTTP API, or both.

## Why LoopEngine

- **Up and running in one command.** `npx create-loopengine@latest` scaffolds
  a real, standalone project — its own repo, a starter agent, CLI and HTTP
  adapters already wired up. `npm install && npm run dev` and you have a
  running agent server, not a half-finished template to wire up yourself.
- **A real Admin UI, not just logs.** Open `/agents/config` in a browser to
  see and edit a live agent: its resolved config, permission rules, skills,
  tool connections, and secrets — no redeploy to change a rule or add a
  skill. See [Admin UI](#admin-ui) below.
- **Human-in-the-loop, wired for real notification channels.** A risky tool
  call or a genuinely ambiguous question routes to a human — live in a chat
  session, or durably via Slack, Lark, email, a generic webhook, or a
  polling queue, resumable minutes or days later. See
  [Human in the loop](#human-in-the-loop) below.
- **Sessions persist automatically.** Send a message, get a reply, come
  back later with the same session id and continue — no database to wire
  up yourself, and it survives a crash mid-turn cleanly.
- **An ability system for reusable capabilities.** Install a bundle of
  tools, a skill, and the permission rules that gate them with one command
  — real, reviewable files in your own repo, not an opaque dependency. See
  [Ability system](#ability-system) below.
- **Does real work, safely.** Tools can hit a database, send emails, call
  GitHub/Slack, anything with an `execute` function. Permission rules gate
  what happens without a human: safe reads auto-run, risky actions get
  approval or are denied outright.
- **Multi-tenant and composable out of the box.** The same deployed agent
  serves different customers with different permission levels, no forking
  required — and one agent's folder drops under another's `subagents/` to
  become a tool the parent can delegate to, own tools/rules/loop intact.

So the payoff: you write one `AgentConfig`, and get a deployable,
persistent, permission-safe service — not just a prompt-and-response demo.

## Quick start

```bash
npx create-loopengine@latest my-agents
cd my-agents
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm run dev             # HTTP server on :8787 — same as `npx loopengine dev`
```

This scaffolds a standalone project — its own repo, with `loopengine` as
a dependency, a starter agent, and CLI + HTTP adapters already wired up.
That's the intended way to use LoopEngine: an independent project you own
and build agents in, not a library you import into an existing app.

### Define your first agent

```bash
npx loopengine add-agent weather-agent
# -> Created agents/weather-agent/index.ts
```

That's the fastest way to start: it generates `agents/<name>/index.ts`
with a working `AgentConfig` stub, so you don't have to memorize the
folder shape by hand. Or write it yourself — an agent is just an
`AgentConfig`: `name`, `systemPrompt`, `tools`, `rules`, and a `model`.
Drop it in a folder under `agents/` — `agents/<name>/index.ts` — and it's
picked up automatically, no registry to edit, no import to add.

Most fields don't even need to be written out — they default to a
conventional path under the agent's own folder:

| Field | Defaults to |
| --- | --- |
| `rules` | `agents/<name>/actauth.yml` (missing → deny everything) |
| `tools` | `agents/<name>/tools/index.ts`'s exported `tools` (missing → no tools) |
| `skillsDirs` | `agents/<name>/skills` (missing → no skills) |

There's no `subagents` field to omit — `agents/<name>/subagents/*` is its
own folder convention (drop another agent's folder there and it becomes
one of this agent's tools automatically), always merged into `tools` on
top of whatever the table above resolves to.

`rules` is how you gate what a tool can do without approval — each rule
maps a `scope` (tenant/environment) + tool name to `allow`/`ask`/`deny`,
with an `ask` decision routing to a human — see
[Human in the loop](#human-in-the-loop) below.

The simplest possible agent, `agents/weather-agent/index.ts` — `tools`,
`rules`, and `skillsDirs` all omitted, so they default to
`agents/weather-agent/tools/`, `actauth.yml`, and `skills/`:

```ts
import type { AgentConfig } from '../../agent-config.js'

export const config: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'weather-agent',
  systemPrompt: 'You answer questions about the weather.',
  model: { provider: 'anthropic', model: 'claude-sonnet-5' }, // reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
}
```

See `agents/customer-service/` and `agents/file-agent/` for complete,
working examples.

## Admin UI

Run the HTTP adapter and open `http://localhost:8787/agents/config` — a
live, editable view of every registered agent, no code changes or
redeploy needed for most of it:

| Tab | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | System prompt, model, every tool (with its JSON schema and parallel-safety), and a read-only view of the rules that would actually apply. |
| **Skills** | Create, edit, and delete `SKILL.md` files for this agent directly in the browser — write the body, preview the rendered markdown, save. |
| **Tools** | Local hand-written tools, gateway-sourced tools (e.g. [Composio](https://composio.dev)), and subagents-as-tools, in one place. Connect a new external gateway source or add/remove a tool without touching a file. |
| **ActAuth** | Add, edit, and delete permission rules — scope, tool, condition, decision — and change `default_decision`, live. |
| **Environment** | Every env var an ability (see [Ability system](#ability-system)) declared it needs, across everything installed for this agent — which ones are set, which are missing, and a form to set one. A value is never echoed back once set. |

Every tab is backed by a real API (`GET /agents/:name/config`, `.../actauth`,
`.../env`, ...) that reuses the exact same resolution `runAgent()` itself
uses — so what you see here can't drift out of sync with what a real
request actually gets, and never returns a model API key.

## Human in the loop

A risky tool call (`actauth`'s `ask` decision) or a genuinely ambiguous
question the model itself raises both need a human — and LoopEngine
handles both the same way, live or durable:

- **Live** — someone's actively watching right now (a terminal, an open
  chat session). The turn just waits; `cli`/`http_stream` get this
  automatically, with nothing to configure.
- **Durable** — nobody's watching (a webhook-triggered run, a ticket that
  came in overnight). The turn ends immediately with a resumable pending
  state, and a real notification goes out on whichever channel you've
  configured — resolvable minutes or days later without holding any
  process open in between.

Six channels ship as real, working notifiers — configure one and the
"send a notification" side is done for you:

| Channel | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `webhook` | Signed HMAC-SHA256 POST to any URL you own |
| `slack` | An interactive message via `chat.postMessage`, with Approve/Deny buttons |
| `lark` | A Lark/Feishu interactive card |
| `email` | A signed, expiring magic-link per decision |
| `database` | Writes a row for your own worker/dashboard to poll |
| `redis` | Pushes a queue entry for your own worker to consume |

```ts
export const config: AgentConfig = {
  // ...
  httpNotifier: {
    channel: 'slack',
    config: { botToken: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN!, channelId: process.env.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID! },
    events: ['approval', 'question'],
  },
}
```

Reference implementations for the receiving side (verifying a Slack
click, a webhook HMAC signature, a magic-link token) ship under
`examples/notifier-handler/` for the four channels that need one. See
[`HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md`](HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md) for the full setup guide —
live and durable, worked examples, and how resumption actually works
under the hood.

## Ability system

Giving an agent a new capability is usually three separate, hand-authored
things: a tool file, a `SKILL.md` teaching the model when to use it, and
an `actauth` rule allowing it to actually run. A **loopengine ability**
bundles all three into one installable unit:

```bash
npx loopengine add-ability <spec> --agent customer-service
```

`<spec>` is anything `npm pack` understands — a public or private npm
package, a scoped package on a private registry, or a plain git repo. The
tool files, skill directory, and actauth rules all land as real files in
the agent's own tree, copied in rather than imported as a `node_modules`
dependency — reviewable, diffable, and editable the same as anything you
would have hand-written, not an opaque black box.

```bash
npx loopengine upgrade-ability <abilityName> --agent customer-service
npx loopengine remove-ability <abilityName> --agent customer-service
```

Upgrading does a real three-way merge per file — a hand-edit since install
survives, a genuine conflict leaves `<<<<<<<` markers to resolve by hand
instead of silently overwriting either side. Removing refuses a file
that's been modified since install unless you pass `--force`. An ability
can also declare the env vars its tools need, which then show up in the
Admin UI's [Environment tab](#admin-ui) automatically once installed. See
[`ABILITIES.md`](ABILITIES.md) for the full design — format, publishing,
and how the merge/upgrade mechanics work in detail.

## Running an agent

`adapters/cli.ts` and `adapters/http.ts` are files your own scaffolded
project owns (see "Quick start" above), not something hidden inside the
`loopengine` package — run them directly with `tsx`, or through shorter
`loopengine` commands that just call the same files for you:

```bash
npx loopengine run customer-service --session s1 "order A-1001 arrived broken"
npx loopengine run customer-service --session s1 --input "order A-1001 arrived broken"
npx loopengine serve   # HTTP server on :8787
npx loopengine dev     # same server, restarts on file changes (tsx watch)
```

`--session <id>` is just an arbitrary string you pick — `s1` above isn't
special, it's only a label. Omit it entirely for a fresh, one-off
conversation each call; reuse the same value on a later call to continue
that exact conversation (the id is printed to stderr if you omit it, so
you can capture it for next time). `--input "<message>"` is an
alternative to the trailing positional message, for scripts that build
the argument list programmatically and would rather not depend on the
message always being the last argument.

`run`/`serve`/`dev` are thin wrappers, not a separate implementation —
each shells out to your project's own `adapters/cli.ts` or
`adapters/http.ts` via `npx tsx` (so it's always *your* copy that runs,
edits included, resolved from your project's own `node_modules`), and
fails with a clear message pointing at `create-loopengine` if that file
doesn't exist yet. `.env` is loaded automatically for all three,
equivalent to passing `--env-file-if-exists=.env` to `tsx` yourself.

The same thing, spelled out without the wrapper:

**CLI:**

```bash
npx tsx adapters/cli.ts --agent customer-service --session s1 "order A-1001 arrived broken"
```

**HTTP:**

```bash
npx tsx --env-file-if-exists=.env adapters/http.ts
curl -X POST localhost:8787/agents/customer-service/messages \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"customerEmail":"a@example.com","message":"order A-1001 arrived broken"}'
```

Add `/stream` to the URL for a Server-Sent Events response — one event per
loop step (tool call, permission decision, budget check) instead of a
single reply at the end.

Three small browser pages, all cross-linked, share one look
(`adapters/dev-ui-styles.ts`), and never need a build step — each is a
self-contained HTML string served straight out of `adapters/http.ts`:

**Agents list:** open `http://localhost:8787/agents` in a browser (the
same route returns plain `{agents: [...]}` JSON to a non-browser client —
content-negotiated on the `Accept` header, so nothing that already calls
it as an API needs to change) to see every registered agent with links
into the playground and config page below.

**Dev playground:** open `http://localhost:8787/playground` (optionally
`?agent=<name>` to preselect one) — pick an agent, chat with it, and watch
that same loop-step event stream render live instead of reading raw SSE
frames. Same `/messages/stream` route underneath.

**Building your own client:** the playground is one UI on top of a typed
event protocol, not the only way to consume a turn — see
[`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) for the full `LoopEvent` catalog, the SSE/
plain-HTTP/CLI transport bindings, and a JSON Schema
(`protocol/loop-event.schema.json`) any language can validate against.
`core/client.ts` and the `examples/chatbox/react`/`examples/chatbox/vue`
hooks are reference implementations of it.

**Agent config page:** this is the [Admin UI](#admin-ui) described above
— open `http://localhost:8787/agents/config` (optionally `?agent=<name>`).

## Wiring a real model

Declare `AgentConfig.model` and the runtime builds a real `ModelCall` for
you, using the matching API key from the environment:

| `provider` | env var | `model` required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `'anthropic'` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | no — defaults to `claude-sonnet-5` |
| `'openai'` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | yes |
| `'deepseek'` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | yes |
| `'kimi'` | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` | yes |
| `'glm'` | `GLM_API_KEY` | yes |
| `'gemini'` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | yes |

`'kimi'`'s env var is `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, not `KIMI_API_KEY` — deliberate,
matching Moonshot AI's own docs (the API/company behind Kimi) rather than
this package's own provider name. `openai`/`deepseek`/`kimi`/`glm`/
`gemini` all reuse the same OpenAI-Chat-Completions-compatible request
translation, just pointed at each provider's own base URL — see
`core/model-calls/*.ts` for the provider-specific details (base URLs,
`max_completion_tokens` vs `max_tokens`, and Gemini's own "still in beta"
caveat on Google's compatibility layer).

For anything else (a custom SDK client, a canned/simulated model for
testing), export your own `createModelCall(): ModelCall` instead.

## Built on

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`actauth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actauth) | Permission gating (allow/ask/deny/pending) with live and durable human-approval hooks |
| `core/budget.ts` / `core/compaction.ts` | Context-window budget tracking and tail-preserving compaction (vendored in-repo, not an external dependency) |
| `core/recovery.ts` | Retries prompt-too-long / truncated-output failures (vendored in-repo, not an external dependency) |
| `core/durable-approvals.ts` | `TurnCheckpoint`/`CheckpointStore` (file/Redis) backing durable, resumable `ask` decisions — see `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP.md` |
| `core/sessionknit.ts` | Durable session log with crash-interruption detection (vendored in-repo, not an external dependency) |
| `core/skillgarden/` | `SKILL.md` discovery and lazy loading (vendored in-repo, not an external dependency) |
| `core/toollane.ts` | Parallel/solo tool-call scheduling (vendored in-repo, not an external dependency) |
| `core/mcpplug.ts` | Gateway tool sourcing (e.g. Composio) (vendored in-repo, not an external dependency) |

Installing `loopengine` pulls in `actauth` as a regular dependency —
install it directly only if you want to use it standalone. Everything
else in this table ships inside `loopengine` itself.

## Deployment

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Builds the HTTP adapter into a container and starts it alongside Redis.
For production, push the image to any container platform with `REDIS_URL`
and your model/tool API keys set as environment variables.

### Hosting behind a platform

These settings are for running LoopEngine inside a hosting platform
(one workspace per user, behind a router that has already authenticated
them). All are off by default; a self-hosted install that doesn't set
them behaves exactly as described above.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `LOOPENGINE_TRUSTED_PROXY_SECRET` | Every request must carry an `X-LoopEngine-Identity` header signed with this secret (`signProxyIdentity` creates one; unsigned requests get 401). `LOOPENGINE_ADMIN_AUTH`, if also set, still works for direct access. Also enables `GET /internal/activity`: in-flight turns, open streams and idle time, so the host never stops a server mid-turn. |
| `LOOPENGINE_EXIT_ON_CODE_CHANGE=1` | After an ability install, upgrade, uninstall or dependency install through the Admin UI, the server drains and exits so the platform restarts it with the new code loaded. Only set this when something restarts the process. |
| `LOOPENGINE_USAGE_LOG` | `stdout` (one JSON line per model call) or a file path (JSON lines) — tokens per call with agent, tenant, session and model. Or call `setUsageSink()` in code. |
| `setSecretStore()` | In code, at startup: keep env values set through the Admin UI somewhere other than `.env` files (a vault, a secret manager). The default `FileSecretStore` is today's behaviour. |

`deploy/workspace/Dockerfile` is a runtime image for this: it serves a
scaffolded project mounted at `/workspace` instead of baking agents in.
