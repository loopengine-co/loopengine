 * keeping only the first one seen and hiding the rest — turns a
 * collision from invisible into something a human looking at the

 * needing one ability's own env var renamed, or a coincidence that's
 * actually fine because both intentionally share one real credential).
 * `secret` is true if *any* declaring ability marked it secret — the
 * safer default, since treating a real secret as non-secret because a
 * different ability's own declaration happened to be checked first
